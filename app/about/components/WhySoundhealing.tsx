        <p className='pb-4'>For all my life, I have felt a strong connection to sound in the form of music. It all began in my earliest years when I experienced many dance classes, including ballet, tap, modern jazz and hip hop. Later, I turned to clubs to get my dancing fix! I have always had an open-mind for music, curious of all genres. Never a professional dancer but loving the FREEDOM that the music and dancing brought to me.</p>
        <p className='pb-4'>These days, I love to attend ecstatic dances, listen to music and play Singing bowls.</p>
        <p className='pb-4'>Dancing is healing. Movement is healing. Music is healing. Sound is healing.

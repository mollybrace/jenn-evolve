        <p className='pb-4'>5 years on and I am back living in London, England. I know that it is safe to return to my London home now because I am different than I was before I left. Before coaching, I was expecting different results but making no changes. Now, I have done (and continue to do) the work on myself with a beautiful collaboration between the body (sound healing) and the mind (coaching).</p>

        <p className='pb-4'>I truly believe that if you want something different for your life, you must make changes to the way that you think and show up in your body. </p>

        <p className='pb-4'>With an undergraduate degree in BSc Psychology, Revolution of the Mind Coaching Training, Champion Coaches for Champion Clients & Advanced Level Sound Healing Certification and being inspired by so many teachers, I am excited to be offering a service that will make a difference to the lives of anyone who is open to believe they can change and think in different ways to get the results that they want.</p>

            <p>Sound Healing is a powerful therapy that combines different healing sounds, music, instruments as well as voice to slow down the brainwaves to a restorative state (theta brain waves), which activate the bodyâ€™s self-healing system, promoting well-being and peaceful relaxation.</p>
            <p className='pt-4'>Every cell, molecule tissue, organ, gland and bone and liquid in our bodies is in constant vibration and has its own state of vibration. Our bodies are made up of on average 60% of water. When we experience sound healing, the frequency (vibrations per second) from the sounds are absorbed by our bodies. During sound healing, our cells vibrate at their optimal frequencies restoring, recharging and rejuvenating the cells.</p>

            <div className='text-5xl pl-4 py-5'>Instruments</div>

            <p>Himalayan Singing Bowls are an authentic, hand-crafted energy-charged instrument brought to the UK from Nepal via Thailand and have been carefully hand-crafted to enhance the vibration, which you will feel running through your body during your meditative experience, supporting you in gaining a deeper connection with your body and away from your mind.</p>
            <p className='pt-4'>I would love to invite you to a restorative and restful sound healing experience. For more information about the sound healing treatments we offer, please go to the sound healing sessions section of the website.</p>
